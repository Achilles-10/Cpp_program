Before there was history there was storytelling Its essential to our human identity The stories we tell are how we know who we are And sharing a tale with an audience can be immensely rewarding But for novices it can also be terrifying Fear of speaking in public is very common  A great many of the world’s greatest performers have struggled with powerful stage fright  So you should know that you’re not alone  We’re here to help you build your confidence and find your own voice  There is no way to get better at telling stories to people than by telling stories to people  There is no substitute for experience  “You just have to get up and do it,” said Aaron Beverly, who finished second in the Toastmasters world championship of public speaking in 2016  (You can watch his delightful speech here.) He compares storytelling practice to a gym workout  To build muscle, weightlifters have to get their reps in  And if you want to develop your skills as a speaker or storyteller, so do you 
The goal, Mr  Beverly said, is to feel so comfortable in the role that you go on autopilot  You build a sort of muscle memory for your body by standing up in front of a crowd, or on a stage, and speaking out  But you don’t have to do it all on a large stage  You can practice at an open-mic night, at a gathering like The Moth, or even at work by leading a meeting  If nerves are holding you back, start as small as possible  Ask a friend to listen and give you feedback 
Sharing a great story is like giving your audience a gift, because it will stay with them  They can even share it further, the same way that stories have been passed along since the beginning of human life
